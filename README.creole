= Fretboard Diagrams =

This tool aims to help the guitar student to print diagrams of the guitar fretboard.
This is something I made to myself, so I could print a few diagrams and draw the shapes for the chords, scales, modes, or whatever.
Feel free to drop an email with suggestions for improvement.
