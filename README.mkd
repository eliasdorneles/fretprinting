= Print your Fretboard Diagrams =

This tool helps you to print blank diagrams of the fretboard of your guitar or bass.
Any fretboard instrument, really!

You can use it to print a few diagrams and use them to draw the shapes for chords, scales, modes or whatever it is that you want to do.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an email: <eliasdorneles@gmail.com>
